I am an enthusiastic MechE by profession and an avid builder at heart.
<blockquote>“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”</blockquote> said the master polymath, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" target="_blank">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. I have always been fascinated by the fact that some of the most complex <a href="Misc_files/sewing_mech.html">machines</a> have some of the simplest mechanical actions at their core. Taking this thought into action, I did my B. Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/" target="_blank">IITBBS</a>. Thereafter, I worked at <a href="https://www.thermaxglobal.com/" target="_blank">Thermax</a> for around two years, upskilling myself and collaborating with some amazing people to work out critical problems in the domains of design, manufacturing, commissioning and troubleshooting of heating systems. And now, I am finally at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> doing MS Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Energy Systems...satifying my inquisitiveness and making my dream of making this world a better place come true.
